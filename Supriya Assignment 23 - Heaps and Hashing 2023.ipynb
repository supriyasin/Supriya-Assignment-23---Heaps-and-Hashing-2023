    "   1. We define a TreeNode class to represent the nodes of the binary tree.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2. The bottom_view function takes the root node of the binary tree as input and prints the bottom view of \n",
    "      the tree using a level order traversal approach.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   4. We use a deque to perform the level order traversal. Each element in the deque is a tuple containing the \n",
    "      node and its horizontal distance (hd) from the root.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   5. We initialize a distance_map dictionary to store the value of the last node encountered at each horizontal distance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   6. During the traversal, we update the value of the distance_map with the value of the node encountered at the current \n",
    "      horizontal distance. Since we are using a deque for the traversal, the last node encountered at each horizontal \n",
    "      distance will overwrite the previous ones, effectively giving us the bottommost node for that distance.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   7. We continue traversing the tree by adding the left and right children of each node to the deque along with their\n",
    "      respective horizontal distances.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   8. After the traversal is complete, we print the values of the nodes from the distance_map in ascending order of \n",
    "      horizontal distance, which gives us the bottom view of the tree.\"\"\""
